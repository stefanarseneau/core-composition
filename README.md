## Core Compositions
---

The objective of this project is to measure the core compositions of white dwarfs. The code for the project can be run via the command:
```
python -m corecomposition
```
with appropriate decorators.

Notes:
* 07/08/2024 #1. The hydrogen-rich models should have a larger radius than the hydrogen-poor models. This does not seem to be the case for the proof-of-concept data with a reliable gravz measurement. The bp-rp excess factor of this source is high, so it's possible that something (e.g. an unresolved brown dwarf) is messing with the measurement.
